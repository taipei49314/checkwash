# Decision log

## D-001 (2026-07-29): stdlib `ast` frontend for v0.1, not tree-sitter

The design doc picked py-tree-sitter + pinned grammar wheels. At M0 kickoff
we deviate: the Python frontend uses the standard library `ast` module behind
the `Frontend` protocol.

Why:
- v0.1 is Python-only (red-team scope cut), so tree-sitter's main advantage
  (one IR pipeline across languages) buys nothing yet.
- Zero runtime dependencies beats "4 pinned dependencies" for a tool whose
  pitch includes minimal supply-chain surface.
- stdlib `ast` gives assertion/comparison structure directly; grammar-version
  drift risk disappears.

Cost accepted: a file with syntax errors cannot be parsed. It is reported as
`skipped_files` (visible degradation, never silent), and a syntax-broken test
file fails CI anyway. Tree-sitter is re-evaluated at the M1 gate when JS/TS
lands; the IR contract does not change either way.

## D-002 (2026-07-29): severity model = base warn + escalators

The three design documents disagreed (per-detector base severities vs uniform
warn + escalator table). Frozen: uniform base `warn`, deterministic
escalator/de-escalator table in SPEC §5. One gating philosophy, one file
(`gating.py`), auditable in one read.

## D-003 (2026-07-29): exemptions are visible, not locked

Original design read exemptions only from base side AND made any
`.greenwash/**` edit critical — which deadlocks the documented
`greenwash allow` flow (red-team finding #1). Resolution in SPEC §6:
append-only additions surface as `EXEMPTION_ADDED` instead of critical.
